// This is a test file to validate the implementation approach
package com.example.footyxapp.ui.player.test

/*
Test the team selection implementation logic:

1. When playerData has multiple statistics:
   - Show team selection card
   - Create TeamLeagueOption list
   - Setup spinner adapter 
   - Display statistics for selected team

2. When playerData has single statistics:
   - Hide team selection card
   - Display statistics directly

Key components:
- TeamLeagueOption data class ✓
- TeamSelectionAdapter ✓ 
- item_team_selection.xml layout ✓
- Updated Player.kt with team selection logic ✓
- Updated fragment_player.xml with team selection UI ✓

Binding references that need to work:
- binding.teamSelectionCard (from android:id="@+id/team_selection_card")
- binding.spinnerTeamSelection (from android:id="@+id/spinner_team_selection")

These follow the standard Android data binding camelCase conversion from snake_case IDs.
